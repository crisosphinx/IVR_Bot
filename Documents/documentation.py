MISSION_STATEMENT = """
Universe was created by Nicolas Barone due to his
frustrations with online learning. He loved the
convenience and affordability of online learning
but saw it lacked the collaborative and engaging
elements of in-person learning. In 2018, he started
the journey of bringing the benefits of in person
learning online through virtual reality. 

Since then Universe has taught 5 courses in VR
with a 4x higher graduation rate than online courses,
has grown to be the 5th largest VR events channel,
and has taught to over 5,000 students. This is the
future of giving everyone access to high quality
education and how Universe is creating the new
reality for online learning.

ABOUT_ME = """
Hello, I am IVR_Bot. I was created by Jeff Miller for
the sake of mitigating data, allowing for ease of access
to projects, classes, data, etc. within multiple classes
and discord servers for Universe(c).

I was created on 11/04/2020 (okay creation started
at this time). I plan on being improved and updated
and if there is ever anything you would like to see done
to me in the future, please contact crisosphinx#9510.

Check out my creators website for more info:

He also makes really cool things, like Blender and Maya
scripts / programs, windows based programs, Unity scripts,
3D Models, Textures, Shaders, Animations, paintings, etc.
I don't really know what he wants to do with his life,
but he really seems to be a go-get-em type of guy.
